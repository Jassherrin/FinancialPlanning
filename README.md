# FinancialPlanning

Form Submission: When the user uploads the documents and submits the form, the backend processes the files, generates a financial plan using OpenAI's API, and then redirects to the chat page with the financial plan as a parameter.

Chat Page: The chat page displays the financial plan and provides an interface for the user to interact with GPT-3.5.
By following these steps, the application will automatically redirect the user to the chat page after displaying the financial plan, allowing for a seamless transition and continued interaction with GPT-3.5.
